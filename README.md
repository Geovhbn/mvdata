###About the data format

All the data is stored in MatLab ".mat" file format. Each ".mat" file contains at least two variables: X and Y. "X" is a cell array of feature matrix (dimension N by d) and "Y" is the label vector (dimension N by 1), where N is the number of data points and d is the dimension of features.
The specification of the data is listed below

**Note**: Caltech-7 and Caltech-20 are two subsets of Caltech-101,  which contains only 7 and 20 classes respectively. The creation of these subsets is due to the unbalance of the number of data in each classes of Caltech-101.

List of features:

- Fourier coefficients of the character shapes (FOU)
- Profile correlations (FAC)
- Pixel averages in 2 Ã— 3 windows (Pix), 
- Zernike moment (ZER) 
- Morphological (MOR) features.
- Gabor feature
- Wavelet moments (WM)
- CENTRIST feature
- Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature
- GIST feature
- Local binary patterns (LBP) feature
- Color Histogram (CH) 
- Color moments (CM)
- Color correlation (CORR)
- Edge distribution (EDH)
- Wavelet texture (WT)
